# NonEmptySwift

Swift Standard Library/Foundation APIs with compile-time guarantee of non-empty collections. Based on [pointfreeco/swift-non-empty](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-nonempty).


## Usage

### `String.components(separatedBy:)`

The `Foundation` method `components(separatedBy:)` is actually guaranteed to not be empty, because even if you call it on an empty `String`, you get `[""]` as a result. And if you pass a separator to it that doesn't exist on the `String`, you'll get back the string itself as the only element in the `Array`. This library makes that guarantee explicit by returning the result wrapped in `NonEmpty`. 

```swift
var text: String = "Ginevra,Harry,Hermione,Ronald"
var nonEmptyComponents: NonEmpty<[String]> = text.components(separatedBy: ",")
// => ["Ginevra", "Harry", "Hermione", "Ronald"]
```
